# Content-Seek
<p>The core idea of this project is to create a web-based application that allows users to perform targeted searches for various types of content (text, PPTs, PDFs, and images) using both text input and voice commands. The application also includes features for speech synthesis, enhancing accessibility by providing voice feedback for search results.</p>

<br>

## Search For:

**Text Input for Search:**

<p>An input field allows users to enter their search queries.</p>

<br>

**Voice Recognition Button:**

<p>A microphone button enables users to use voice commands for entering search queries.</p>

<br>

**Voice Output Control:**

<p>A button to toggle speech synthesis, which reads out the results to the user.</p>

<br>

**Submit Button:**

<p>Submits the search query for processing.</p>

<br>

**Specific File Type Search Buttons:**

<p>Buttons labeled "PPT", "PDF", and "Images" allow users to perform searches for specific file types.</p>

<br>

## Note:

<p>Make sure to update with your API key and search engine ID in the JavaScript code to use the application.</p>
